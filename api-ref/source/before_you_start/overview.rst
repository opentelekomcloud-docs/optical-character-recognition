Overview
========

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) detects and extracts text from images and converts the text into an editable JSON format.

OCR is provided to you through open APIs. You can access and call APIs in real-time to obtain inference results, which helps you automatically collect key data and build intelligent business systems, ultimately improving business efficiency.

Before calling an OCR API, make sure you have a thorough understanding of the relevant concepts listed in :ref:`Basic Concepts <ocr_03_0064>`.
