Why Don't I Have Programming Access Permission?
===============================================

When calling an API, if you receive the error message "code":403,"message":"This user only supports console access, not programmatic access.", it means that you do not have the programming access permission.

IAM users do not have programming access permissions. You need to contact the main account holder to adjust the permissions.

The main account holder can log in to the IAM console, click **Security Settings** in the **Operation** column for the corresponding IAM user, and enter the settings page.
