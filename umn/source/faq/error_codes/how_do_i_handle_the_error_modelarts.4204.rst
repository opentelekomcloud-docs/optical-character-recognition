How Do I Handle the Error ModelArts.4204?
=========================================

If ""error_code":"ModelArts.4204","error_msg":"Request api error! The API XXX is not subscribed." is displayed when you call an API, it indicates that you have not subscribed to the API. For details about how to subscribe to an API, see :ref:`Subscribing to a Service <ocr_01_0153>`.

If the service has been subscribed to, check whether the region (or account) where the service is subscribed to is the same as the region (or account) where the service is called. If they are the same, check whether the URL of the API is spelled correctly.
