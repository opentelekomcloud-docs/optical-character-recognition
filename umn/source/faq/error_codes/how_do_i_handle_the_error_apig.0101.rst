How Do I Handle the Error APIG.0101?
====================================

The error message "The API does not exist or has not been published in the environment." is displayed.

-  Check whether the API URL is correct. For example, check whether the project ID is included in the URL.
-  Check whether the region information in the URI is consistent with the endpoint for subscribing to the service.

-  Check whether the HTTP request method (such as POST and GET) is correct.
-  For details about the URI, see the corresponding API page.
