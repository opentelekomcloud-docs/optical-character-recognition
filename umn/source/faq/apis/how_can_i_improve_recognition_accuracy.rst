How Can I Improve Recognition Accuracy?
=======================================

-  Use high-quality images with clear text and no glare as much as possible. When collecting images, try to increase the proportion of the area with text to be recognized, reduce the proportion of irrelevant background, and keep the text in the image clear and recognizable to the human eye.
-  If the image has a rotation angle, the algorithm supports automatic correction, and it is recommended not to excessively tilt the image.
-  Regarding image size, it is recommended that the longest side should not exceed 8192 pixels, the shortest side should not be less than 15 pixels, and the aspect ratio of the image should be within the common horizontal 5:1 (please refer to the API documentation of each service for specific requirements).
