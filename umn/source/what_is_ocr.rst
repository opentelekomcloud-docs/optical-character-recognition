What Is OCR?
============

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) detects and extracts text from images and converts the text into an editable JSON format.

OCR provides open APIs, so you can use programming languages such as Python and Java to call OCR APIs to extract text from images. OCR allows you to automate the collection of key data. It helps you build an intelligent service system to improve efficiency. For details about how to obtain APIs, see *Optical Character Recognition API Reference*.

Before You Start
----------------

You must have programming capabilities and be familiar with Java, Python, iOS, Android, and Node.js.

To use OCR, call APIs to detect and extract text from images or scanned documents, convert the text into an editable JSON format, and enter the results into business systems by coding or save them in formats such as TXT or Excel.

OCR Capabilities
----------------

-  General OCR

   Detects and extracts text from images in any format, including tables and documents, and adapts to a range of different layouts and table formats.

Using OCR for the First Time
----------------------------

If you are a first-time user, the following sections are a good place to start:

-  Functions

   Going through this :ref:`Functions <ocr_01_0028>` section, you will be able to learn about a collection of OCR functions.

-  Getting Started

   OCR provides open APIs for you. For details about how to use OCR, see :ref:`Getting Started <ocr_01_0153>` and *Optical Character Recognition API Reference*.
